<h1 align="center">DuckOS</h1>
<h5 align="center">DuckOS is a online web-based operating system written mostly with Java and HTML. Proxy backend from Ultraviolet<br>App store is coming soon, and put some app suggestions in Issues</h5>
<h1 align="center">About this Project</h1>
There are alot of other web-based OSes on github; tough I never found one that really suited my needs. So I decided to take matters into my own hands, thus creating DuckOS. Of course, DuckOS can never replace your real operating system, this is just something I created for fun, and might even make a little money by selling it at school lol
<h1 align="center">Usage</h1>
Just use this as you usually would on your own computer, but enjoy the extra apps you can't on a chromebook! (And, if you noticed, the proxies) Enter fullscreen with F11 or the fullscreen button on your chromebook for the best experience.<br><h4>Website blocked?</h4><br>You can host the website by yourself, with your own domain that you can register from <a href="https://freenom.com">Freenom</a> or <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org">FreeDNS (Afraid.org)</a> by cloning this repository and linking it to your Netlify account. Further instructions won't be neccessary since it will be on Netlify
